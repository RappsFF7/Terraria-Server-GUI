* ABOUT *
*********

This application is written in .net framework 4 (which is only logical since the server is also in .net framework 4). I am using an express edition of Visual Studios 2010 (though I'd much prefer an express of 2008 after working in 2010 for a while now) which is what the solution file is saved as.

TerrariaServerGUI-Alpha-1.0.zip

This server is now wrapped in a fully functioning GUI that allows command line access once the server has started. The GUI allows saving and selecting of multiple config files. There is not a ton of error checking so you can likely crash the server by trying odd things.
