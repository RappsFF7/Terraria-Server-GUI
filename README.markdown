#### About
***

This application is written in .net framework 4 (which is only logical since the server is also in .net framework 4). I am using an express edition of Visual Studios 2010 (though I'd much prefer an express of 2008 after working in 2010 for a while now) which is what the solution file is saved as.

#### Releases
***

##### _Alpha 1.2_

Added logging (but not all logging options are available), timestamps, debug menu (in case the GUI does not properly interpret the server output and change it's state for starting and stopping of the server), shortcut to config file folder

##### _Alpha 1.1_

Added autosaving and now save the config file as a txt (to make it more apparent users can edit it by hand if neccessary).

##### _Alpha 1.0_

This server is now wrapped in a fully functioning GUI that allows command line access once the server has started. The GUI allows saving and selecting of multiple config files. There is not a ton of error checking so you can likely crash the server by trying odd things.
